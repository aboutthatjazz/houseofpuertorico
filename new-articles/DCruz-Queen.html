            <p align="left" class="bodyText2"><span class="bodyText"><img src="../images-web/prflag_50.gif" alt="Puerto Rican Flag" width="50" height="37" hspace="2" align="left" /><img src="../images-web/queens/articles/Dasiy 1_250.jpg" alt="Daisy Cruz - HPRSD 2008-09 Queen" width="250" height="333" hspace="2" align="right" /><strong>I have attended the events and  meetings of the House of Puerto Rico since my parents, Benjamin and Lori Cruz,  have been members.</strong> For about nine years now, I can say that the House of Puerto  Rico and its members have watched me grow. However, it is disappointing to say  that it was not until just recently, that I have  felt a sense of belonging and true accomplishment with the House of Puerto  Rico. During my parent&rsquo;s many years as members, I have seen the House of Puerto  Rico as something that they, my parents and their friends, were part of. Until  recently, I realized that I also had the power to be involved and contribute to  the House of Puerto Rico. &nbsp;</span></p>

            </span></p>
            <p align="left" class="bodyText2"><span class="bodyText">What did it  take, you might ask, for me to become involved and feel like I was a part of  the House of Puerto Rico? Well, it was nothing more than a phone call from  Angie Freeman; someone that I had heard a lot of great things about, but had  never met in person. After talking with her a few minutes over the phone, I  heard something that made my mind soar. <em>&ldquo;What? Run for queen for the House of  Puerto Rico? Me?!&rdquo;</em> I thought quietly in my head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a college student, not a  beauty queen...&rdquo; All of this and more ran through my head as I listened to  Angie&rsquo;s friendly voice. Little did I know, that phone call would change my association  with the House of Puerto Rico. <br />
  </span></p>
            <p align="left" class="bodyText2"><span class="bodyText"> After  moments of pondering the proposal of running for queen, I decided to go for it.  I was going to take a chance and hope for the best. Even if I wasn&rsquo;t selected,  there had to be something valuable that I could derive from this experience.  When I attended the practice rehearsal, I saw the other girls; they were  friendly, caring, confident and enthusiastic as they stood side by side, with  their strict &lsquo;Cinderella feet&rsquo; and improving posture. From that moment on, I  knew that ultimately it wasn&rsquo;t about the crown, but about the person who&rsquo;s  wearing it. Someone&rsquo;s physical appearance is minimal compared to their  self-confidence, poise, personality and beliefs. <br />
  </span></p>
            <p align="left" class="bodyText2"><span class="bodyText"> <img src="../images-web/queens/Court08-09/Court08-09_300.jpg" alt="HPRSD 2008-09 Queen's Court" width="300" height="443" hspace="2" align="left" />It has been  a few months since then, and I couldn&rsquo;t be more thankful for the unforgettable  journey I have embarked on. A majority of membership votes showed that I had  been chosen as the queen of the House of Puerto Rico, which became known at the  House of Puerto Rico Lawn Program. When I first heard the news, I stood on  stage, adorned with my vibrant folkloric dress and was accompanied by the rest  of the contestants. I can still remember the cheerful summersault my heart  made, which was probably accompanied by a great smile. As I look back at all of  the things that I have accomplished in the past few months, I can&rsquo;t help but  smile. The House of Puerto Rico has opened countless doors to new  opportunities, experiences, memories, and positive change, as long with  opportunity for self-discovery and personal development. </span></p>

            <p align="left" class="bodyText2"><span class="bodyText">My  experience would have not been the same if it wasn&rsquo;t for my close involvement  with the group of <a href="../reinitas.html">Las Reinitas Borincanas</a>. This group is primarily composed of  the House of Puerto Rico mini princesses, junior princesses, princesses, and  myself. It is because of this group, and our main advisor, Angie Freeman, that  I have had the chance to become further involved in other ways other than just  attending meetings and formal events. So far, I have been able to learn and  perform danza with Las Reinitas group at various events, including the <a href="../gala-navidad.html">House of  Puerto Rico Gala</a> and Father Joe&rsquo;s Villages. Also, I have worked with the other  girls in baking and decorating Christmas cookies, and later distributing them  with the parranda group to elderly nursing homes and Andres Patio restaurant. The  more formal events I have attended have been a coronation dance where I was  crowned along with other queens from the <a href="http://www.sdhpr.org" target="_blank">House of Pacific Relations</a>. I was also  asked to attend an installation dinner in commemoration of the new House of  Pacific Relations officers. Aside from these events, I am required to attend  events for the House of Pacific Relation Queen&rsquo;s Association, such as monthly  meetings and December Nights festivities.<br />
            </span></p>
            <p align="left" class="bodyText2"><span class="bodyText">Sharing this extraordinary experience with  generations from now, I will look back at one of the most memorable experiences  of my life. There are not enough thank you&rsquo;s to convey how thankful I am for  being given the opportunity to be part of the House of Puerto Rico in such a  special way. Not only do I feel more involved with the House of Puerto Rico,  but also more aware of the Puerto Rican culture. It is my dream to continue  seeing as much, or even more, youth involvement with the House of Puerto Rico. Ultimately,  the future of the House of Puerto Rico will lay within us, the upcoming  generations. </span>&nbsp;</p>
