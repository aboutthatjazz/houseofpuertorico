            <p><strong>On a cool Tuesday evening, the  young men and boys from the Boy Scout Troop 95 Tierra Santa toured some of the <a href="http://www.sdhpr.org">House of Pacific Relations</a> cottages thanks to the effort and arrangement made by Beth  Connelly from the House of Ireland.</strong></p>
            <p>When the email arrived to our  attention at the House of Puerto Rico there was no way that I was not going to  make the extra effort to support her and the Boy Scouts. So quickly I responded  and asked for more details.</p>

            <p>I contact Dee Flores and asked if  Eva and Antonio could join me in costume so that the Scouts could see some of  our folk traditions, too.&nbsp;Eva wore one of the HPRSD traditional dresses and Antonio  wore his vejigante costume. The Flores family  were super generous, an extra special effort was made due to the fact that Eva  was under the weather and not feeling well.</p>
            <p><img src="../images-web/outreach/BoyScouts09/IMG_3265-350.jpg" alt="Eva and Antonio Flores showing traditional Puerto Rican costumes" width="350" height="263" hspace="2" align="left" />The scouts&nbsp;were to come by  the different houses between 7 and 8   p.m. in small groups and the reason for their visit was that they  had a project to learn about different cultures.&nbsp; </p>

            <p>I so happened to have the front  cover of the <em>El Nuevo Dia</em> (Puerto Rican newspaper) from March 20 where our  astronaut Joseph Acaba was on the cover, photographed in the space shuttle just  after being awakened by <em>Que Bonita Bandera</em> - a song honoring our Puerto Rican  Flag.&nbsp;&nbsp;I had this on display and found online the music with lyrics  which I played for them.&nbsp; </p>
            <p>I also shared with them what the  Garita in the casita was used for&nbsp;and showed them a photo that we had of  one on El Morro.&nbsp; They also viewed the Holiday  theme display, letting them know what types of materials were used to make some  of them, paper towels, coffee beans and nails.</p>
            <p>Some stopped to view the DVD that  I had running, and one or two of our guests recognized places in Puerto Rico  because they had been there.</p>
            <p>Later Antonio and I went off to  the House of Ireland to get hot chocolate for him and Eva and one of the older  scouts told him that he really was impressed with his vejigante mask.&nbsp; He asked how long it took and Antonio looked  at me and I said about 2 -3 hours.&nbsp; The  young man said he could not have done such a fine job in that time.</p>
            <p>The adults, young men and boys and  family members present were very appreciative of all the houses that made this  extra effort to open for them.&nbsp;<em class="subHeader12 style24"> We, of course, were very&nbsp;honored!</em></p>
