The explosion and its aftermath killed two of the 26  officers, and 250 of the 329 sailors and marines aboard. It was the explosion  of the Maine that precipitated the outbreak of the Spanish American War which  was declared by President William McKinley in April, 1898. <br />
            </p>
            <p>The Maine was in Cuba, then  a colony of Spain, to protect American property during a period of revolution  and upheaval. However, the Spanish Government did not appreciate America&rsquo;s  presence in Cuba. To this day, the question still remains as to what caused the  explosion. After an inquiry into its cause, the U.S. Naval Board of Inquiry  blamed it on a Spanish mine. <br />
            </p>
            <p>An important aspect of the  Spanish American War was the United States&rsquo; military plans, battles, and  excursions, both in Puerto Rico and in Cuba. This war lasted a little over  three months, or from late April to early August, 1898. (The signing of the  Treaty of Paris officially ended the war on December 10, 1898.)<br />
            </p>
            <p>Since 1998 marks the 100th  Anniversary of the United States&rsquo; involvement in the affairs of Puerto Rico  after almost 400 years of Spanish rule, it is an appropriate time to reflect  upon our historical past. The United States has influenced not only the people  in Puerto Rico, but also the nearly three million Puerto Ricans residing in the  United States.<br />
            </p>
            <p>According to some  historians, the Spanish-American War has had an on-going, as well as a  long-lasting, effect on those countries that were somehow involved. For  example, both Puerto Rico and the United States, as well as Cuba, Guam, the  Philippines, and Hawaii, were all directly impacted by this war. In the book  &quot;Extraordinary Americans,&quot; by Susan Sinnott (1991), Ms. Sinnott ponts  out in the chapter entitled &quot;Remember the Maine: The Spanish American War  and Its Aftermath&quot; that &quot;The Spanish American War was short but the  results were far-reaching. The Spanish lost their holdings in Cuba, Puerto Rico  and the Philippines. The United States was left, if not in control of the  colonial empire, then at least in a much more responsible position than before.  The end of the war pushed the United States into the world arena&mdash;it was now a  major international power.&quot; <br />
            </p>
            <p>The book, &quot;Everything  You Need To Know About Latino History&quot; (Himilce Novas, 1994, pp. 152-154),  offers a description on how Puerto Ricans felt about Spanish rule toward the  end of the 19th Century.<br />
            </p>
            <p>Further, Himilce Novas  observed that just prior to United States&rsquo; involvement and subsequent  occupation of Puerto Rico in July, 1898, Spain had earlier granted local  government control, as well as the right to elect native representatives to  local government, and these representatives would have full say over local  taxes, budgets, and education. Ironically, on July 17, 1898, just a scant eight  days before the United States&rsquo; &quot;military expedition&quot; landed and  hoisted the American Flag in Guanica, Puerto Rico (July 25, 1898), Mu&ntilde;oz Rivera  was voted Puerto Rico's first independent governor. This was a first step  toward Puerto Rico&rsquo;s hope for independence.<br />
              </p>
            <p>As a result of the Spanish  American War, Puerto Rico became a United States protectorate. This was the  beginning of a complex relationship (referred to by different names over the  years) that continues until today, as well as the ongoing debate on what the  status of Puerto Rico should be. <br />
              </p>
            <p>I have reviewed the New  York Times newspaper articles published during 1898, specifically, those which  had as a headline the Spanish American War as it related to Puerto Rico. <br />
