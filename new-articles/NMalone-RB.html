            <p>When I talked it over with my daughter Jessica, she was a  bit hesitant as she does not speak Spanish.&nbsp;  I told her it would be ok if we needed to learn a song(s) we could  practice together.&nbsp; Of course Jessica was  excited about the beauty part of it, never mind she couldn&rsquo;t speak the  language.&nbsp; My mother is always after me  to<em> &ldquo;teach her some Spanish.&rdquo;</em>&nbsp; I knew I  had my work cut out for me.</p>

            <p>Soon we were practicing for the inaugural walk and the choosing  of the court, which would be held at one of the member meetings.&nbsp; The members would vote for the queen and  princess and the winner would be announced at the annual HPRSD Lawn Festival in  September.&nbsp; During the rehearsals we met  fellow members; it was a good way to get acquainted with and make new  friends.&nbsp; </p>
            <p><img src="../images-web/queens/Court08-09/Gala08_Malone-200.jpg" alt="Jessica &amp; Nelly Malone" width="200" height="227" hspace="2" align="left" />Jessica was chosen as Jr. Mini Princess the announcement  came during the lawn festival.&nbsp; The look  of joy on her face was priceless.&nbsp; She  did manage to learn all the lyrics to <strong>&ldquo;Mi Viejo San Juan&rdquo;</strong> and could be heard  belting out the tunes in Spanish with the other girls.&nbsp; She was very proud of herself.&nbsp; I remember Angie saying <em>&ldquo;not bad for someone  who doesn&rsquo;t speak Spanish.&rdquo;</em>&nbsp; </p>

            <p>Soon we were  practicing for Paranda nights, the Gala and baking cookies for two senior homes  to be delivered during the Christmas season.&nbsp;  Jessica really looked forward to these gatherings as it was a time to  get together with her new friends.&nbsp; I too  enjoyed myself sharing with fellow members our holiday traditions.&nbsp; The court practiced a Danza taught by member  and dance instructor Jose Lopez.&nbsp; It was  a beautiful piece and the girls got to put their best foot forward for the  seniors at St. Paul Villa and St. Paul Manor.&nbsp;  They also performed for HPR members and their guests at the Christmas  Gala held at the Portuguese Hall.&nbsp; We  recently participated at the San Diego Multi-Cultural Fair over the Martin Luther King  weekend.&nbsp; The weather was spectacular and  my heart swelled with pride watching my little Jr. Mini Puerto Rican Princess  talk to other kids about Puerto Rico and El  Coqui.&nbsp; </p>
            <p>Thank you Angie, Casilda, Emily and the rest of you who  donated your time to make it all come together.&nbsp;  This was one of the best holiday season Jessica and I have had in a long  time.&nbsp; </p>
