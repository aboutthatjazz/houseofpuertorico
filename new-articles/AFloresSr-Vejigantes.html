            <p>Time went by and we were very, very busy.&nbsp; We didn&rsquo;t attend the meetings.&nbsp; We hardly went to any events.&nbsp; Then one day our daughter became involved  with HPRSD&rsquo;s Queens Program and things really started to pick up.&nbsp; The members made her one of their princesses and  my wife and kids were attending events and activities a lot.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
Then one day I went with my wife to one of the meetings and  Emily asked if I would be interested in a father son type of deal and  participate in an event.&nbsp; &ldquo;You and your  son will be Vejigantes and we have another father and son who will participate  too,&rdquo; She told me. &nbsp;Vejigante?&nbsp; What&rsquo;s a Vejigante?&nbsp; I really wasn&rsquo;t sure if I wanted to commit to  doing this, but my wife kept on my case about how this could help me to connect  to my Puerto Rican roots and get to know people, etc. etc.</p>
            <p>Emily showed us a video about it.&nbsp; My son and I got measured for the costume and  Emily measured us for the mask.&nbsp; Once the  mask was ready my son and I each painted one.&nbsp;  The day that we painted the masks was also a day that the Reinitas had  practice for Danza.&nbsp; They were preparing  for a performance at a retirement home.&nbsp;  It was a fun day because they baked and decorated cookies and we ordered  pizzas.&nbsp; </p>

            <p>Painting the mask was fun and relaxing.&nbsp; I painted it in my own style, but with colors  Emily gave me to make sure it matched the costume.&nbsp; I made it my own, adding details that meant  something to me.&nbsp; My son sat next to me  and painted his mask.&nbsp; He was happy and  excited to be able to make his own.&nbsp; It  was actually the first time that we had actually done anything like that  (together).</p>

            <p>&nbsp;I got to know some of  the members.&nbsp; I like this group.&nbsp; The people are nice and you feel like you are  welcome.&nbsp; I feel that now that I&rsquo;m  involved in something, I am more connected with House of Puerto Rico.&nbsp; I have more pride in being Puerto Rican and I  think it&rsquo;s going to be a good thing for me and my family.&nbsp; Now I look forward to meetings and events at  the House of Puerto Rico. </p>
