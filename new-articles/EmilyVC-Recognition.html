            <p>Dr. Antonio Grillo informed me a few weeks prior that the La  Jolla Rotary International Club was going to present <span class="style24">Angie Freeman</span> with the  <span class="subHeader">2009 Paul Harris Fellowship Award</span> during this meeting.&nbsp; This was wonderful and exciting news since  Angie has been an integral part of our organization for at least two years and  at the end of 2008 she stepped up to change the dynamics of our youth program.</p>

            <p>The Paul Harris Fellowship award is presented to candidates  for doing good in the world &ndash; the certificate read: <em>&ldquo;in appreciation of tangible and significant assistance given for the  furtherance of better understanding and friendly relations among peoples of the  world.&rdquo;</em></p>
            <p>Angie &ndash; whose birth name is Angela (Angel), was born in the  Dominican Republic and moved to Puerto Rico with her family just a few months  old and moved away again at the age of 4 &frac12;. She and her family moved to update New York and eventually  to San Diego  where she graduated from our Lady of Peace High School. </p>
            <p>She met Gus Freeman, her husband thanks to her brother,  while both were in the US Marine Corps. She and Gus got married and lived in Yuma, AZ  where she attended Southwestern   University and obtained a  degree in Fashion Merchandising. She and Gus have two daughters: Arlene, a USC  graduate with a degree in Communications; and Alyssa, a Chapman University  graduate with a degree in Liberal Arts Studies and Education. Gus, while in the  Marines was a gunnery sergeant and is a veteran of the 1st Gulf War,  now retired after 20 years of service. He currently works in the construction  business and is employed by the San Diego County Office of Education.&nbsp; Angie is currently an Elementary School  Assistant to the Principal &ndash; secretary and office manager at the Sunset View   School in Point Loma, CA.</p>
            <p><span class="subHeader12">Angie&rsquo;s tireless community and volunteer service includes:</span><br />

            <p><strong>2. The House of Puerto Rico  San Diego</strong> &ndash; She  is the founder and coordinator of the Reinitas Borincanas girls program for the  organization, which provides the youth with folkloric dance training, which  also focuses on Puerto Rican culture and traditions. She started with 8 girls  and young ladies, ranging from the age of 6 to 23 and now has 33 including boys  and young men as part of the Jovenes Boricuas program.&nbsp; Her service has change the dynamics of the  HPRSD youth program and the young parents involvement in our organization.</p>
            <p>The activities the youth have offered include dancing for  seniors, dancing at Petco Park in center field, at Family Day in Balboa Park,  at the HPRSD Lawn Program, at St. Vincent de Paul Village for their Easter  Fashion Show.&nbsp; They have cleaned the  local San Diego Beaches, help serve the Homeless, sent Valentines to our troops  and seniors and have performed at various San Diego County Blood Drives.</p>

            <p>She battles Diabetes, Lupus, Aplastic Anemia and LGL  Leukemia for over 16 years and despite the treatments and her low blood counts  that require regular transfusions, she is a bundle of energy and has an amazing  drive that sets the bar high for all of us to try and reach. She currently is  waiting to have a bone transplant which is possible thanks to the match she has  found in her brother. </p>
            <p>She is an inspiration to me personally &ndash; her motto is &ldquo;I can  do everything through HIM who gives me strength.&rdquo; </p>
            <p>Thank you so much &nbsp;-  you are our own ANGEL &ndash; Angie!</p>
