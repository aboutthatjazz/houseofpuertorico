<p>Dear Fellow Puerto Rican and Friends of Puerto Rico:</p>

<p>The City of San Diego is offering the Puerto Rican community an opportunity to build a
cottage (una casita) in Balboa Park. This will be a cottage where we can permanently
display our culture, history, and contributions made by fellow Puerto Ricans to the United
States of America. It will be a meeting place for the San Diego community and worldwide
visitors. It will be a place for our senior citizens and young military personnel away
from home to socialize. It will also be an educational place for everyone, especially
future generations who will have minimal exposure to the Puerto Rican experience.</p>

<p>Beautiful Balboa Park is home to many museums and is the cultural center of San Diego.
The House of Puerto Rico San Diego is a member of the House of Pacific Relations (also
known as The Cottages). Being a member of the House of Pacific Relations affords us the
opportunity to build a cultural cottage of our own.</p>

<p>Currently, there are 19 cottages representing various countries. None of the cottages
represent a Latin country. The City of San Diego will be adding three more cottages and
the House of Puerto Rico has requested one of these sites. If we do not take advantage of
this unique and wonderful opportunity NOW, someone else will!</p>

<p>The City of San Diego will provide the land at no cost to us, however, we are required
to have $120,000 in the bank prior to breaking ground to cover construction costs. We will
also need monies for furnishing, appliances and exhibition facilities.</p>

<p>As you can see, this calls for the most urgent and immediate attention of the Puerto
Rican community, as well as friends of Puerto Rico, to support this much needed and noble
project. This will be the only structure in the state of California dedicated to the
history, culture and heritage of Puerto Rico.</p>

<p>We are asking you to be a part of this endeavor today, by contributing to the <b>House
of Puerto Rico Building Fund</b>. Building approval by the City of San Diego is
tentatively scheduled for Fall of 2000. Funding must be in place prior to ground breaking.</p>

<p>All donations will be tax deductible. Donations of $5,000.00 or more will be honored
with a permanent plaque in the name of the company, organization, family name or that of a
loved one. Donations of $1,000.00 or more will be honored with an engraved brick which
will be placed at the cottage. All donor names will be entered in the building registry
album which will be kept on the premises.</p>

<p>We are including a <a HREF="Contribution_Form.html">contribution form</a> for you to
fill out and return to us with your generous contribution. Feel free to make copies of
this letter and distribute it to all persons interested in helping to build Puerto Rico's
only cultural cottage in the west coast. For further information please call 858-481-2995.</p>

<p>Thank you for your support.
