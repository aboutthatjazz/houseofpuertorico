            <p><u>Special Classes</u>:<br />
            A special class has been added to facilitate fathers &amp; sons (or mothers with sons) to make  vejigante masks to participate in the Vejigantes dance troop. This dance troop (a precursor to the new Jovenes Boricuas) will accompany the <a href="reinitas.html">Reinitas Borincanas</a> in folk dance performances throughout the year. If your son is interested in joining, please contact <a href="mailto:Evelezconfer@aol.com">Emily Velez-Confer</a> for details.</p>
            <p class="subHeader14">Art Classes  2008</p>
            <p class="bodyText"><img src="images-web/art/EmTchng2-200.jpg" alt="Art Classes" width="200" height="266" hspace="5" align="right" />Late in 2008 art classes were offered to the Members of the  House of Puerto Rico. These art classes were offered the second Saturday of  August, September and October which were well received and attended.</p>
            <p align="center" class="body_bold5-14"><strong>August&rsquo;s class  focused on <em><br />
              Piraguas</em> &ndash; Puerto Rican Snow Cones</strong></p>
            <p class="bodyText">Almost every child has special memories of having piragua so  I thought this would be a wonderful what to start the art class series.</p>
            <p class="bodyText">I wrote a short story which I read to the children and  parents in attendance, coloring pages with visuals of the piragua man and his  cart were colored by all in attendance.&nbsp;  Each child was able to create a piragua made out of an actual pointed  cup and paper for the syrupy ice.</p>
            <p class="bodyText">As a special surprise, each child got a real piragua to  enjoy. They selected from two favored syrups and away they went.</p>
            <p align="center" class="bodyText"><img src="images-web/art/HPRSD-Art-081608_009-200.jpg" alt="Making a piragua" width="200" height="266" /> <span class="style1">..........</span><img src="images-web/art/HPRSD-Art-081608_006-200c.jpg" alt="Enjoying a refreshing piragua" width="200" height="258" /></p>

              Vejigante</em> Masks &ndash; Puerto Rican Carnival Masks</strong></p>
            <p class="bodyText">Many of us have heard of and learned about the Vejigantes &ndash;  Puerto Rican Carnival Characters, but so many of us have never see an actual  mask.</p>
            <p class="bodyText">During September&rsquo;s art class each child and parent had the  opportunity to have a photo taken with a real Loiza mask, see the mask in use  with the full costume as represented in a poster by Samuel Linz. </p>
            <p class="bodyText"><img src="images-web/art/masks_72-200.jpg" alt="Kids with Vejigante masks" width="200" height="267" hspace="5" align="right" />From there they received coloring sheets with different  types of costumes and masks, made a mask out of construction paper and painted  miniature masks out of walnuts (donated by Ralph Costas).</p>
            <p align="center" class="body_bold5-14"><strong>October&rsquo;s class  focused on <br />
                <em>Los Tres Reyes</em> -&nbsp; the Three  Kings tradition</strong></p>
            <p class="bodyText">Thankfully our Dia de Reyes tradition is alive and well in  Puerto Rico.&nbsp; The House of Puerto Rico  celebrates each January during our first meeting of the year a culture corner  and activity for the children to experience this tradition.</p>
            <p class="bodyText"><img src="images-web/art/3550Best-200.jpg" alt="Best Three Kings art work" width="200" height="222" hspace="2" align="left" />So earlier than usual a Three King art class was offered  which allowed children to make Three King figures from Nestle Chocolate Milk  Bottles by wrapping them with tissue paper. Their crowns came from the bottle  lid, and each one had a face made of a wooden ball.</p>
            <p class="bodyText">Each child decorated a crown and also was able to make a box  with straw and decorate it to place under their bed on Jan 5 to feed the  &ldquo;horses&rdquo; &ndash; in Puerto Rico we do not have  camels. In turn a gift from a King would be left under their bed.</p>
            <p class="bodyText">A special thank you to two friends of the House of Puerto  Rico, Diane Martin and Kathy Gurling for their help and support during  October&rsquo;s class.</p>
            <p class="bodyText">It was and is a privilege for me to offer these classes to  our members, we have such a great time. I look forward to the art classes being  offered in 2009.</p>

            <p>Born in San Antonio,   Texas of Puerto Rican parents,  Emily moved to the island with her family when she was one year old, and lived  in San Juan for  19 years.&nbsp; While growing up in Puerto  Rico she traveled extensively around the island accompanying her father on many  of his business and family trips and experienced the sights, sounds and  cultural of the island.</p>
            <p>Though Emily has since moved to California, and now resides  in San Diego, she continues to explore the island with her father on visits  that she makes regularly&mdash;always  ready for a new experience or ready to  reacquaint herself with something from her childhood.</p>
            <p>From these special memories of her travels throughout Puerto Rico, the United States and Europe  she has developed various creative approaches to record her memories.&nbsp; One of her techniques is creating colored  pencil illustrations in various sizes and creating miniature clay  figurines.&nbsp; She also has produced acrylic  and watercolor paintings.&nbsp; </p>
            <p><img src="images-web/art/ArtClassAnnouncement-Blank-450.jpg" alt="Announcement" width="450" height="591" hspace="5" align="left" />She completed one year at the University of Puerto Rico and  then upon moving to California, received an AA degree from Long Beach Community  College and a Bachelors Degree in Fine Arts from CalPoly, Pomona, California.</p>
            <p>Emily currently works for Father Joe&rsquo;s Villages&reg;  / St. Vincent de Paul Village as a traffic /production coordinator in the  organization&rsquo;s Communications Department. And though it has been many years  since completing her studies in Fine Art, she is now refocusing her energy with  a new found passion in her art during her free time.</p>
            <p>Emily is a Life Time Member of the House of Puerto Rico as  of June, 2002.&nbsp; Her first fine art  showings were for the House of Puerto Rico where she donated and continues to  donate her art work to raise funds for La Casita. She works in colored pencil  and does photography. All proceeds from the silent auction sales or any sales of  her work goes directly to the House of Puerto Rico.</p>
            <p>For the past three years she has been the coordinator of the  Silent Auction for the Fiesta de Navidad/Christmas Gala for the HPRSD, as well.  It is her desire to help promote and support Puerto Rican artists who live on  the island or stateside.</p>
            <p>As of August 2008, Emily has offered Cultural Art Classes at  the House of Puerto Rico at the <em>Casita</em> Museum which is open to members and the general public.&nbsp; These classes touch on learning about Puerto  Rican culture and traditions in a fun way. </p>
            <p>As of January 2009, Emily is the President of the House of Puerto  Rico San Diego.</p>
