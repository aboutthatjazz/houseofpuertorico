<meta name="description" content="The City of San Diego is offering the Puerto Rican community an opportunity to build a cottage (una casita) in Balboa Park. This will be a cottage where we can permanently display our culture, history and contributions made by fellow Puerto Ricans to the United States of America. It will be a meeting place for the San Diego community and worldwide visitors. It will be a place for our senior citizens and young military personnel away from home to socialize. It will also be an educational place for everyone, especially future generations who will have had minimal exposure to the Puerto Rican experience.">

    Casilda Pagán joined forces and organized La Casa de Puerto Rico with a vision of
    preserving the richness of the Puerto Rican culture and acknowledge the need to share this
    vision with the people of the San Diego community. In becoming so, La Casa de Puerto Rico
    has reached out to our roots and built something more than an organization, La Casa de
    Puerto Rico built a family.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; La Casa de Puerto Rico family is about support, belonging and working
    together.&nbsp; La Casa de Puerto Rico has helped to build a strong Puerto Rican unity in
    our community and the reason why is because we are always educating ourselves about our
    history and culture. But most importantly, we have always been here for each other and we
    are here for you.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Statement of Objective:</strong><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The objectives of La Casa de Puerto Rico are to promote a better
    understanding amongst people of all nationalities and races, to promote and cultivate the
    Puerto Rican culture and to promote social activities amongst its members.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Statement of Purpose:</strong><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The mission of La Casa de Puerto Rico is to promote an awareness of the
    social cultural, educational, economics and political contributions of the Puerto Rican
    community. La Casa de Puerto Rico works diligently to maintain the mission and envision
    expanding to other parts of California.<br>
