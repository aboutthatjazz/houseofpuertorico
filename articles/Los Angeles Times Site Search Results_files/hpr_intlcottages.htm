    House of Pacific Relations</h2>
    <hr SIZE="5">
    <p>The House of Pacific Relations (HPR), founded in 1935, is a non-profit community
    organization dedicated to furthering cooperation and understanding between national groups
    in the United States. At present, 1998, it consists of 28 national groups. Two thirds of
    these groups have their own small cottage in San Diego's Balboa Park. These cottages,
    furnished and manned by members of these groups, present exhibits about their culture,
    history, and traditions.</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="../images/hprcott2_50.jpg" WIDTH="204" HEIGHT="139"></p>
    <p>The cottages are open to the public for four hours every Sunday afternoon, between noon
    and 5:00pm, except Christmas and New Year's Day. Refreshments are served and donations are
    welcome to defray their cost. Group members are present to welcome visitors and answer
    questions. All work is done by unpaid volunteers.</p>
    <p>On Sunday afternoons during the months of March through October, <a HREF="HPR_LP2001.htm">Lawn Programs</a> are held on the outdoor stage in the cottage area.
    Each national group has its own Lawn Program, featuring the ethnic songs, dances and food
    of the group. Lawn Programs start at 2:00pm and last one hour.</p>
    <p>Other <a HREF="HPR_LP2001.htm">special events</a> include the Lawn Program of the
    Cottage Queens, the Ethnic Food Fair and Christmas on the Prado.</p>
    <p>The Hall of Nations, which adjoins the cottage area, has exhibits of national groups
    and is open on Sundays from noon to 5:00pm. Countries without cottages hold their open
    houses in the Hall of Nations on a rotation basis.</p>
    <p>The cottages are also open on the 4th Tuesday of each month to the general public, and
    on the 2nd Friday of each month during the school year for school children.</p>
    <p>The public is invited to visit and join the International Cottages in San Diego's
    Balboa Park. For more information, call 619-234-0739 or 469-8948.<dl>
