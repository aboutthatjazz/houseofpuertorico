    its Effects on Puerto Rican Migration</font></em></strong></b></h2>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">&nbsp; 1998 is the 100 year anniversary of
    the Spanish American War, which, upon its ending with the signing of the Treaty of Paris
    on December 10, 1898, resulted in Puerto Rico, the Philippines, Hawaii, and Guam being
    ceded to the United States. It is an appropriate time for each and every Puerto Rican
    throughout the world, especially in the United States and Puerto Rico, to reflect on how
    we have been personally affected by the events that occurred as a result of this war.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As most of you know,
    Puerto Rico&#146;s second worst hurricane (San Ciriaco, 1899) left the island economically
    devastated and its people suffering. Consequently, Puerto Ricans began migrating to
    countries like Santo Domingo, Mexico, and Hawaii (then a U.S. territory), with the hope of
    seeking better livelihoods, always thinking and hoping that one day they would return to
    their homeland.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Spanish American
    War, however, also had a profound effect on subsequent Puerto Rican migration to the
    United States. There was an ever-increasing number of Puerto Ricans on the island feeling
    the necessity to migrate shortly after the beginning of the 20th century. Thus, the mass
    exodus to the United States began as early as 1900 and continued well into the 1990s.
    Today, nearly one half of the more than six million Puerto Ricans worldwide and their
    descendants live within the United States as opposed to on the island. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Puerto Rican
    sociologist, Dr. Clara E. Rodriguez, in her book entitled The Ethnic Queue in the U.S.:
    The Case of Puerto Ricans (1974, San Francisco), made the following observations on the
    origins of the historical relationship of Puerto Rico, the Puerto Rican migration, and the
    United States, when she pointed out that:</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;...it is important to present that
    from which...Puerto Ricans came in order to better us as a people entering the United
    States environment. In this way, with an understanding of the histories and perspectives
    of the United States and of Puerto Ricans we will hopefully better understand the effects
    of the contact, i.e., the migration.&quot;</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It has been almost 100
    years since the Spanish American War began and ended, and the subsequent Puerto Rican
    population figures during this mass migration process to the United States are
    overwhelming. For example, Luis Antonio Cardona, in his recent book entitled A History of
    Puerto Ricans in the United States of America (1995, Vol. 1, Carreta Press), presents a
    demographic chart displaying the Puerto Rican population movement to the United States,
    from 1910 through 1990, as follows:</font></p>

    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to
    summarizing the above population migration figures, Mr. Cardona presented the effects this
    migration process had on Puerto Ricans arriving into the United States, when he stated the
    following, from the Introduction of A History of Puerto Ricans in the United States of
    America:</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;Toward the end of the 19<sup>th</sup>
    century, there were few Puerto Ricans in New York City. Some were merchant seamen who
    traveled between San Juan and American ports. Sons of well to do families who previously
    studied in Paris, Madrid, London, and Rome, now came to American universities in New York,
    Philadelphia, Boston, and Chicago. Many political refugees came to New York.&quot;</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;By 1910, there were little more than
    1,532 Puerto Ricans in New York City; by 1930, 40,000; by 1960, 60,000. The piers of
    Brooklyn were the first landing places for the earliest Puerto Rican migrants. They had
    spent most of their lives in a relatively homogeneous tropical island. The lifestyle was
    highly personal based on one to one contact. They shared common values, with minor social
    concerns. Economic, business, religious, and political matters were handled in a relaxed
    way...In New York, Puerto Ricans became part of a highly complex industrial
    society....&quot;</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the October, 1997
    issue of Hispanic Business, an article entitled Puerto Rican Population by County, 1996,
    identified the present Puerto Rican population distribution within the United States, by
    County, as follows:</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;Puerto Ricans living on the mainland
    generally are associated with the Empire State. Four of the five counties with more than
    100,000 Puerto Ricans are in New York City (the fifth is Chicago&#146;s Cook County). But
    new centers are popping up in areas such as San Antonio, Houston, Los Angeles, and
    Hawaii.&quot;</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;Outside the Northeastern U.S., there
    are at least 18 counties with 10,000 or more Puerto Ricans. Smaller but growing
    pockets&#151;between 1,000 and 10,000&#151;can be found in Southern California, north
    Texas, Nevada, Arizona, Colorado, and Washington State.&quot; Therefore, what we have,
    continuing to this day, is what has previously been identified as the Puerto Rican
    Diaspora (from Historical Perspectives on Puerto Rican Survival in the United States,
    1997).</font></p>
