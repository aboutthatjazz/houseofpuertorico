    Puerto Rico: 1898</font></em></strong></b></h2>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; On the morning of July 25,
    1898, under the command of &quot;Indian fighter&quot; Major General Nelson A. Miles, the
    U.S. military, with an expeditionary force of 8,000 troops and several naval ships,
    invaded Puerto Rico. The first indication that Guánica, a harbor village on the southern
    coast with about 1,000 inhabitants, was the target of invasion, occurred when the USS
    Gloucester, under the command of Lt. Commander Wainwright (formerly of the USS Maine),
    fired a three-pounder at a Spanish flag. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The U.S. War Department
    thought the first attack would have taken place in Fajardo, in the north. However,
    militarily speaking, the harbor at Guánica was determined to be the best spot to begin
    the invasion. Not only was Guánica protected by very high cliffs, but the town was not
    nearly as heavily fortified, nor defended with as many Spanish troops, as was San Juan. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This military campaign,
    historically known as the Porto Rican Campaign, did not last very long. The American flag
    was raised within a day of the landing of U.S. troops in Guánica. On July 27, a New York
    Times headline read as follows: &quot;Our Flag Raised in Puerto Rico. Four Spaniards Fall
    in the First Fight of the Invasion. Guánica, on the Southern Coast, the Scene of the
    Landing. Excellent Military Road Leads to San Juan, 85 Miles Distant&#151;Good Work Done
    by the Gloucester.&quot;</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Three days after the
    invasion of Guánica, General Guy Henry and his men captured Yauco while General Miles
    went down the coast to the nearby town of Ponce. The goal of the United States was to
    subdue Ponce, and ultimately, San Juan. Ponce was captured without gunfire. The ultimate
    objective was to build up the army of occupation for Puerto Rico.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Albert Nofi&#146;s book,
    The Spanish-American War, 1898, (1996), identifies the four different landings on the
    island, as well as the various towns which the U.S. military entered, or had military
    battles or skirmishes in (Guánica, Ponce, Yauco, Guayamo, Cape San Juan, Guayamo-Cayey,
    Coamo, Hormigüeras, Aibonito Pass, and Las Marias). Dr. Nofi contends that &quot;The
    Puerto Rican Campaign included some of the best tactical maneuvering of the
    [Spanish-American War]....&quot;</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On July 29, 1898 the
    U.S. issued a general proclamation to the people of Puerto Rico assuring them that the
    Americans had come to the island to bring them freedom from Spanish rule and not to make
    war on its inhabitants. This was the first official public statement from the U.S.
    Government regarding its plans for Puerto Rico.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On July 31, 1898 more
    troops arrived in Guánica. They headed toward Arroyo with plans to advance on Cayey.
    Mayagüez, Lares, Utuado, Coamo, and Guayana were also targeted. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The book, The Puerto
    Ricans, A Documentary History (Edited by Karl and Olga Jiménez Wagenheim, Markus Weiner
    Publishers, N.J., 1994), contains several accounts of events that occurred during this
    military campaign. Among them is a reprint (pages 96-98) from the work of famed American
    poet, Carl Sandburg, who saw active service in Puerto Rico, beginning with the invasion in
    Guánica. Sandburg wrote about these experiences in his book entitled, Always the Young
    Strangers (New York: Harcourt, Brace, 1953 ). </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Editor&#146;s Note: A contemporaneous
    description (with photos) on the U.S. military excursions which occurred mostly in the
    southern part of the island can be found in Richard Harding Davis&#146; book, The Cuban
    and Porto Rican Campaigns, 1898, pages 264-360.</font></p>
