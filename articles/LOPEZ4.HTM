    Invasion of Puerto Rico</em></strong></b></font></h2>
    <font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></font><font face="Arial" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On June 2, 1898, <u><i>The</i> <i>New York Times</i></u> had
    the foreboding headline of &quot;Plans For Invasion,&quot; wherein it described the United
    States&#146; military plans and operations for the invasion of Puerto Rico, as part of the
    on-going Spanish-American War being fought with colonial Spain. The U.S. officially
    divulged its intention to invade Puerto Rico by landing troops onto the island nation for
    the express purpose of eventually setting up a military government.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On June 5, 1898, a <i>Times
    </i>lead article entitled, &quot;Army About To Move: Puerto Rico Will be Invaded by Troops
    Under Gen. Lee,&quot; indicated that the military movement against Puerto Rico was near
    and this fact was made clear by the U.S.&#146;s Assistant Secretary of War Meiklejohn when
    he &quot;disclosed the fact that four transports have been ordered to proceed....&quot;
    and to be prepared for possible military action. In addition to the men being mobilized,
    the U.S. also got readied a number of ships. The destination of these troops, under the
    command of Major Gen. Fitzhugh Lee, was San Juan de Puerto Rico. No actual date for the
    ships&#146; departures was provided to the newspaper, nor was any date set for the
    possible invasion of Puerto Rico.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On June 13, 1898,
    another <i>Times&#146; </i>article entitled,<i> </i>&quot;Invasion of Puerto Rico,&quot;
    stated that the U.S. War Department&#146;s efforts and plans for the invasion of Puerto
    Rico were to be on its forefront. However, the military decided to hold off on the
    invasion of Puerto Rico until Santiago, Cuba was taken. The U.S. determined that the
    Spanish forces and troops in Puerto Rico were relatively small in number, although the
    fear was that there still might be some military effort required to invade the island. The
    article noted that Admiral Sampson &quot;found that the reduction of the forts and
    batteries of San Juan was no child&#146;s play, and that he succeeded in doing little
    damage to them in three hours of bombarding.&quot; It was estimated that approximately
    12,000 to 15,000 troops would be needed for the invasion of Puerto Rico.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, on June 30,
    1898, the <i>Times </i>had the rather sensational article entitled, &quot;Fight At Puerto
    Rico,&quot; wherein it described how the Spanish warship, <i>Antonio Lopez</i>, was
    spotted by American ships while trying to enter the river San Juan, near San Juan de
    Puerto Rico, with war cargo; but the warship escaped any damage when it swiftly changed
    its course. The <i>Antonio Lopez</i> was identified as being a &quot;small gunboat built
    for service in Cuban and Puerto Rican waters.&quot;</font></p>
