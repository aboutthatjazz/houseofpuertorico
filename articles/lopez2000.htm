content="The City of San Diego is offering the Puerto Rican community an opportunity to build a cottage (una casita) in Balboa Park. This will be a cottage where we can permanently display our culture, history and contributions made by fellow Puerto Ricans to the United States of America. It will be a meeting place for the San Diego community and worldwide visitors. It will be a place for our senior citizens and young military personnel away from home to socialize. It will also be an educational place for everyone, especially future generations who will have had minimal exposure to the Puerto Rican experience.">

        On February 15, 1898, the battleship USS Maine, stationed

        in Havana Harbor (Cuba), exploded and sank to the bottom

        of the sea. The explosion and its aftermath killed two of

        the 26 officers, and 250 of the 329 sailors and marines

        aboard. It was the explosion of the Maine that

        precipitated the outbreak of the Spanish American War

        which was declared by President William McKinley in

        April, 1898. </font></p>

        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

        The Maine was in Cuba, then a colony of Spain, to protect

        American property during a period of revolution and

        upheaval. However, the Spanish Government did not

        appreciate America&#146;s presence in Cuba. To this day,

        the question still remains as to what caused the

        explosion. After an inquiry into its cause, the U.S.

        Naval Board of Inquiry blamed it on a Spanish mine. </font></p>

        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

        An important aspect of the Spanish American War was the

        United States&#146; military plans, battles, and

        excursions, both in Puerto Rico and in Cuba. This war

        lasted a little over three months, or from late April to

        early August, 1898. (The signing of the Treaty of Paris

        officially ended the war on December 10, 1898.)</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

        Since 1998 marks the 100th Anniversary of the United

        States&#146; involvement in the affairs of Puerto Rico

        after almost 400 years of Spanish rule, it is an

        appropriate time to reflect upon our historical past. The

        United States has influenced not only the people in

        Puerto Rico, but also the nearly three million Puerto

        Ricans residing in the United States.</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

        According to some historians, the Spanish-American War

        has had an on-going, as well as a long-lasting, effect on

        those countries that were somehow involved. For example,

        both Puerto Rico and the United States, as well as Cuba,

        Guam, the Philippines, and Hawaii, were all directly

        impacted by this war. In the book &quot;Extraordinary

        Americans,&quot; by Susan Sinnott (1991), Ms. Sinnott

        ponts out in the chapter entitled &quot;Remember the

        Maine: The Spanish American War and Its Aftermath&quot;

        that &quot;The Spanish American War was short but the

        results were far-reaching. The Spanish lost their

        holdings in Cuba, Puerto Rico and the Philippines. The

        United States was left, if not in control of the colonial

        empire, then at least in a much more responsible position

        than before. The end of the war pushed the United States

        into the world arena&#151;it was now a major

        international power.&quot; </font></p>

        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

        The book, &quot;Everything You Need To Know About Latino

        History&quot; (Himilce Novas, 1994, pp. 152-154), offers

        a description on how Puerto Ricans felt about Spanish

        rule toward the end of the 19th Century.</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

        Further, Himilce Novas observed that just prior to United

        States&#146; involvement and subsequent occupation of

        Puerto Rico in July, 1898, Spain had earlier granted

        local government control, as well as the right to elect

        native representatives to local government, and these

        representatives would have full say over local taxes,

        budgets, and education. Ironically, on July 17, 1898,

        just a scant eight days before the United States&#146;

        &quot;military expedition&quot; landed and hoisted the

        American Flag in Guanica, Puerto Rico (July 25, 1898),

        Muñoz Rivera was voted Puerto Rico's first independent

        governor. This was a first step toward Puerto Rico&#146;s

        hope for independence.</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

        As a result of the Spanish American War, Puerto Rico

        became a United States protectorate. This was the

        beginning of a complex relationship (referred to by

        different names over the years) that continues until

        today, as well as the ongoing debate on what the status

        of Puerto Rico should be. </font></p>

        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

        I have reviewed the New York Times newspaper articles

        published during 1898, specifically, those which had as a

        headline the Spanish American War as it related to Puerto

        Rico. </font></p>
