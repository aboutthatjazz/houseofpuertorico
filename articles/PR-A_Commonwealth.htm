        <p>On the 19th of November 1493, Christopher Columbus discovered the island 
          of Puerto Rico. San Juan was already a city in the early 1500s. One 
          of the first universities in the New World was founded there. One of 
          the earliest attempts to colonize the US was led by Juan Ponce de Leon, 
          governor of Puerto Rico, when around 1513 he led a small fleet from 
          San Juan to the coast of Florida. Puerto Rico remained under Spanish 
          rule and was granted autonomy in the late 1800s. During the Spanish 
          American War, the US defeated the Spanish Navy in the Pacific and the 
          Atlantic. The American fleet then proceeded towards Puerto Rico. There 
          were landings at a couple of points on the island. The fleet laid siege 
          to San Juan and bombarded the fortresses and the city. The 5000 defenders 
          surrendered to the landing force of 15000. Thus, in 1898, Puerto Rico 
          became a colony of the USA. The Foraker Act of 1900 made Puerto Ricans 
          &quot;citizens of Puerto Rico, entitled to the protection of the US&quot;. 
          In 1917, congress passed the Jones Act granting US citizenship to all 
          persons born in Puerto Rico. In 1950, congress enacted Law 600 that 
          recognized Puerto Rico's right to self-rule and authorized the organization 
          of a government based on a constitution drawn up by Puerto Ricans. The 
          constitution creating the &quot;<a href="http://www.cincuentenario.gobierno.pr/">Estado 
          Libre Asociado de Puerto Rico</a>&quot; (Commonwealth of Puerto Rico) 
          was effective on the 25th of July 1952. Since then, Puerto Ricans have 
          elected their own governor, cabinet members, and congress. Puerto Rico 
          elects a &quot;Resident Commissioner&quot; in Washington who sits in 
          congress (and can be a committee member) with voice but no vote. Puerto 
          Ricans can vote in the US elections if they reside in the continental 
          US. However, they cannot be candidates for the presidency of the US 
          if they were born outside the continental US.</p>

        <h3 align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>First 
          US Shot of World War I in Puerto Rico</b></font></h3>
        <p>Puerto Ricans have participated and contributed as citizens of the 
          US in many different ways. In the Armed Forces, they have participated 
          in every conflict in which the US has been involved since 1898. The 
          first shot of World War I (by the US) was fired by a Puerto Rican serving 
          in the US Army, Colonel Teofilo Marxuach. </p>
        <p>Colonel Marxuach was officer of the day at El Morro Fortress, at the 
          entrance to San Juan Bay, on the 21st of March 1915. On that day, an armed supply ship 
          for German submarines in the Atlantic, the Odenwald, tried to force 
          its way out of the bay. Colonel Marxuach opened fire from the walls 
          of the fortress and forced the ship to return to port and be interned. 
          Medals earned by Puerto Rican servicemen and women include four Congressional 
          Medals of Honor and numerous Silver and Bronz Stars. The <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/news/Oct1999/n10291999_9910291.html">65th 
          Infantry Regiment </a>was one of the most decorated units in the Korean 
          War. Puerto Ricans were awarded more Purple Hearts than servicemen from 
          any other state on a per capita basis. Other distinguished Puerto Ricans 
          in military service include <a href="http://www.achievement.org/autodoc/page/nov0bio-1.htm">Antonia
