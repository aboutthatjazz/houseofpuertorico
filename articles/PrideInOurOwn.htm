        <p align="left">We are proud to announce that one of our own members has been  selected in receiving a very difficult to earn national award. <u>Pedro Hernandez</u>  will receive the <a href="PH-Announcement.PDF">Department of Defense Meritorious Service Award</a> given by the  National Image, Inc. The award recognizes leasers that distinguished themselves  in promoting civil rights, equal opportunity,  community service, and enhancing a positive understanding between Hispanics and  members of the military and civilian population of the Nation. The award will  be presented in a large gala in Las    Vegas on April 17th.  These events are attended by high senior military and civilian government  officials, including: heads of the President's cabinet, Senators, and Congress  officials. Other attendees include celebrities and foreign dignitaries.</p>
        <p>Pedro was selected as the only active duty Marine Corps  recipient. That's an amazing accomplishment for three reasons: (1) He was  selected out of 175,000 Marines; (2) He now belongs to a rare group of only 19  previous Marines being recognized for the award; (3) I have been informed by reliable  headquarters' officials familiar with the program that Pedro is very likely the  first Marine of Puerto Rican decent to earn the award.
