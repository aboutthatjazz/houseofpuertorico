It will be a meeting place for the San Diego community and worldwide visitors. It will be a place for our senior citizens and young military personnel away from home to socialize. It will also be an educational place for everyone, especially future generations who will have had minimal exposure to the Puerto Rican experience.">

        Effects on Puerto Rican Migration</font></p>

        <p align="center"><font size="1" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></p>

        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1998 is

        the 100 year anniversary of the Spanish American War,

        which, upon its ending with the signing of the Treaty of

        Paris on December 10, 1898, resulted in Puerto Rico, the

        Philippines, Hawaii, and Guam being ceded to the United

        States. It is an appropriate time for each and every

        Puerto Rican throughout the world, especially in the

        United States and Puerto Rico, to reflect on how we have

        been personally affected by the events that occurred as a

        result of this war.</font></p>

        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As most

        of you know, Puerto Rico&#146;s second worst hurricane

        (San Ciriaco, 1899) left the island economically

        devastated and its people suffering. Consequently, Puerto

        Ricans began migrating to countries like Santo Domingo,

        Mexico, and Hawaii (then a U.S. territory), with the hope

        of seeking better livelihoods, always thinking and hoping

        that one day they would return to their homeland.</font></p>

        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The

        Spanish American War, however, also had a profound effect

        on subsequent Puerto Rican migration to the United

        States. There was an ever-increasing number of Puerto

        Ricans on the island feeling the necessity to migrate

        shortly after the beginning of the 20th century. Thus,

        the mass exodus to the United States began as early as

        1900 and continued well into the 1990s. Today, nearly one

        half of the more than six million Puerto Ricans worldwide

        and their descendants live within the United States as

        opposed to on the island. </font></p>

        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Puerto

        Rican sociologist, Dr. Clara E. Rodriguez, in her book

        entitled The Ethnic Queue in the U.S.: The Case of Puerto

        Ricans (1974, San Francisco), made the following

        observations on the origins of the historical

        relationship of Puerto Rico, the Puerto Rican migration,

        and the United States, when she pointed out that:</font></p>

        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;...it is important

        to present that from which...Puerto Ricans came in order

        to better us as a people entering the United States

        environment. In this way, with an understanding of the

        histories and perspectives of the United States and of

        Puerto Ricans we will hopefully better understand the

        effects of the contact, i.e., the migration.&quot;</font></p>

        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It has

        been almost 100 years since the Spanish American War

        began and ended, and the subsequent Puerto Rican

        population figures during this mass migration process to

        the United States are overwhelming. For example, Luis

        Antonio Cardona, in his recent book entitled A History of

        Puerto Ricans in the United States of America (1995, Vol.

        1, Carreta Press), presents a demographic chart

        displaying the Puerto Rican population movement to the

        United States, from 1910 through 1990, as follows:</font></p>

        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In

        addition to summarizing the above population migration

        figures, Mr. Cardona presented the effects this migration

        process had on Puerto Ricans arriving into the United

        States, when he stated the following, from the

        Introduction of A History of Puerto Ricans in the United

        States of America:</font></p>

        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Toward the end of

        the 19<sup>th</sup> century, there were few Puerto Ricans

        in New York City. Some were merchant seamen who traveled

        between San Juan and American ports. Sons of well to do

        families who previously studied in Paris, Madrid, London,

        and Rome, now came to American universities in New York,

        Philadelphia, Boston, and Chicago. Many political

        refugees came to New York.&quot;</font></p>

        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;By 1910, there were

        little more than 1,532 Puerto Ricans in New York City; by

        1930, 40,000; by 1960, 60,000. The piers of Brooklyn were

        the first landing places for the earliest Puerto Rican

        migrants. They had spent most of their lives in a

        relatively homogeneous tropical island. The lifestyle was

        highly personal based on one to one contact. They shared

        common values, with minor social concerns. Economic,

        business, religious, and political matters were handled

        in a relaxed way...In New York, Puerto Ricans became part

        of a highly complex industrial society....&quot;</font></p>

        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the

        October, 1997 issue of Hispanic Business, an article

        entitled Puerto Rican Population by County, 1996,

        identified the present Puerto Rican population

        distribution within the United States, by County, as

        follows:</font></p>

        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Puerto Ricans living

        on the mainland generally are associated with the Empire

        State. Four of the five counties with more than 100,000

        Puerto Ricans are in New York City (the fifth is Chicago&#146;s

        Cook County). But new centers are popping up in areas

        such as San Antonio, Houston, Los Angeles, and

        Hawaii.&quot;</font></p>

        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Outside the

        Northeastern U.S., there are at least 18 counties with

        10,000 or more Puerto Ricans. Smaller but growing pockets&#151;between

        1,000 and 10,000&#151;can be found in Southern

        California, north Texas, Nevada, Arizona, Colorado, and

        Washington State.&quot; Therefore, what we have,

        continuing to this day, is what has previously been

        identified as the Puerto Rican Diaspora (from Historical

        Perspectives on Puerto Rican Survival in the United

        States, 1997).</font></p>

        Official reports indicate that the autonomy scheme

        projected for Puerto Rico has been put into successful

        operation. This is interesting mainly because of

        resemblance between the project and the plan which it is

        now sought to put into play in Cuba....the whole

        population seemed to be happy over the thought that

        &#145;home rule&#146; at last had been granted to Puerto

        Rico.&quot;</font></p>

        leaves Havana will go to Puerto Rico in order to

        strengthen the hands of the Government officials there.
