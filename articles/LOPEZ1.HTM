    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; On February 15, 1898, the
    battleship <strong>USS Maine</strong>, stationed in Havana Harbor (Cuba), exploded and
    sank to the bottom of the sea. The explosion and its aftermath killed two of the 26
    officers, and 250 of the 329 sailors and marines aboard. It was the explosion of the Maine
    that precipitated the outbreak of the Spanish American War which was declared by President
    William McKinley in April, 1898. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Maine was in Cuba,
    then a colony of Spain, to protect American property during a period of revolution and
    upheaval. However, the Spanish Government did not appreciate America&#146;s presence in
    Cuba. To this day, the question still remains as to what caused the explosion. After an
    inquiry into its cause, the U.S. Naval Board of Inquiry blamed it on a Spanish mine. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An important aspect of
    the Spanish American War was the United States&#146; military plans, battles, and
    excursions, both in Puerto Rico and in Cuba. This war lasted a little over three months,
    or from late April to early August, 1898. (The signing of the Treaty of Paris officially
    ended the war on December 10, 1898.)</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since 1998 marks the
    100th Anniversary of the United States&#146; involvement in the affairs of Puerto Rico
    after almost 400 years of Spanish rule, it is an appropriate time to reflect upon our
    historical past. The United States has influenced not only the people in Puerto Rico, but
    also the nearly three million Puerto Ricans residing in the United States.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to some
    historians, the Spanish-American War has had an on-going, as well as a long-lasting,
    effect on those countries that were somehow involved. For example, both Puerto Rico and
    the United States, as well as Cuba, Guam, the Philippines, and Hawaii, were all directly
    impacted by this war. In the book &quot;Extraordinary Americans,&quot; by Susan Sinnott
    (1991), Ms. Sinnott ponts out in the chapter entitled &quot;Remember the Maine: The
    Spanish American War and Its Aftermath&quot; that &quot;The Spanish American War was short
    but the results were far-reaching. The Spanish lost their holdings in Cuba, Puerto Rico
    and the Philippines. The United States was left, if not in control of the colonial empire,
    then at least in a much more responsible position than before. The end of the war pushed
    the United States into the world arena&#151;it was now a major international power.&quot; </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The book,
    &quot;Everything You Need To Know About Latino History&quot; (Himilce Novas, 1994, pp.
    152-154), offers a description on how Puerto Ricans felt about Spanish rule toward the end
    of the 19th Century.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, Himilce Novas
    observed that just prior to United States&#146; involvement and subsequent occupation of
    Puerto Rico in July, 1898, Spain had earlier granted local government control, as well as
    the right to elect native representatives to local government, and these representatives
    would have full say over local taxes, budgets, and education. Ironically, on July 17,
    1898, just a scant eight days before the United States&#146; &quot;military
    expedition&quot; landed and hoisted the American Flag in Guanica, Puerto Rico (July 25,
    1898), Muñoz Rivera was voted Puerto Rico's first independent governor. This was a first
    step toward Puerto Rico&#146;s hope for independence.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a result of the
    Spanish American War, Puerto Rico became a United States protectorate. This was the
    beginning of a complex relationship (referred to by different names over the years) that
    continues until today, as well as the ongoing debate on what the status of Puerto Rico
    should be. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have reviewed the New
    York Times newspaper articles published during 1898, specifically, those which had as a
    headline the Spanish American War as it related to Puerto Rico. </font></p>
