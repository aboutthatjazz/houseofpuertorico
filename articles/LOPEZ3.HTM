    <font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></font><font face="Arial" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One hundred years ago on the morning of May 12, 1898, under
    the command of U.S. Admiral William T. Sampson, San Juan, Puerto Rico was bombarded by the
    United States military. Ten days earlier, on May 2nd, Lt. Henry H. Whitney was sent to
    Puerto Rico on a reconnaissance mission sponsored by the U.S. Army&#146;s Bureau of
    Military Intelligence. On May 10, 1898, Spanish forces in the Fortress of San Cristóbal
    in San Juan had exchanged gunfire with the USS Yale, under the command of Capt. William
    Clinton Wise. These military actions were part of the United States&#146; early
    involvement in the Spanish-American War with colonial Spain.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During May 1898, The New
    York Times featured several front page articles on the bombardment of San Juan as well as
    plans for additional military actions by the United States against Puerto Rico,
    specifically, San Juan. Part of a dispatch Admiral Sampson sent to the Navy Department was
    quoted in the Times as follows: &quot;This attack lasted about three hours and resulted in
    much damage to the batteries and incidentally to a portion of the city adjacent to the
    batteries.&quot; The dispatch also stated that &quot;No serious damage to any (American)
    ships was reported.&quot;</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to the Times,
    &quot;the north end of Morro Castle was in ruins, the Cabras Island fort was silenced, and
    the San Carlos battery was damaged. Although the Americans suffered only two casualties
    and seven injuries, the Spanish Governor General of Puerto Rico issued a proclamation
    saying eight soldiers were killed and 34 wounded as a result of the bombardment of the
    forts at San Juan.&quot; </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The refugees in San Juan
    were reportedly terrorized; and because the inhabitants feared the reappearance of the
    American fleet and a repetition of the bombardment, they fled to the country, out of range
    of the American guns. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At 7:45 AM, after three
    hours of fighting, Admiral Sampson signaled &quot;cease firing&quot; and withdrew his
    fleet. One of the ships, the monitor Terror, failed to understand the order and kept on
    bombing the Morro Castle for half an hour more, alone. Admiral Sampson later was quoted as
    saying, &quot;I am satisfied with the morning&#146;s work. I could have taken San Juan,
    but I have no force to hold it. I only wanted to administer punishment.&quot; A Times
    article entitled &quot;San Juan Surrendered?&quot; quoted The Evening News (from St.
    Thomas) as saying, &quot;San Juan de Puerto Rico surrendered at 6 o&#146;clock yesterday
    evening.&quot;</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A May 20<sup>th</sup>
    article reported &quot;The Spaniards at San Juan &#133; will burn the city before they
    will surrender.&quot; Based on information from a Puerto Rican refugee who fled to the
    United States via St. Thomas, the Times also reported that &quot;The whole island was
    under martial law and the people were simply groaning under it.&quot;</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In its article, &quot;To
    Move on Puerto Rico,&quot; the Times reported &quot;that Puerto Rico and not Cuba is to be
    the first object of invasion by the combined land and naval forces of the United
    States.&quot; Over 30,000 troops were mobilized to Tampa, Florida in preparation for an
    invasion of either Cuba or Puerto Rico&#151;the military did not wish to divulge their
    real objectives and plans. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, on May 31st an
    article entitled &quot;Troops Ordered to Invade Cuba,&quot; with a sub-headline of
    &quot;An Invasion of Puerto Rico Not Improbable,&quot; pointed out that &quot;the
    determination of the Administration to push the war &#133;led to planning of the
    expedition to Puerto Rico, and that expedition has never been lost sight of. The greater
    healthfulness of the Island of Puerto Rico over Cuba and the smaller force to be
    encountered, together with the comparable lack of preparation on that island, have pointed
    to the probable quick success of any expedition sent to Puerto Rico.&quot;</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was just a short two
    months later, on July 25, 1898, that the next major event of the Spanish-American War
    involving Puerto Rico occurred, namely, the landing of American troops and the invasion of
    Puerto Rico at Guánica. (This event will be covered in the July issue of The Puerto Rican
    Connection.)</font></p>
